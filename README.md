## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2.  Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O).
3.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4.  If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
